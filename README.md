Image Edge Detection and Noise Reduction

Description:

This Python-based image processing project is designed to enhance image edges and reduce noise in a set of uploaded images. It utilizes various image processing techniques, including Gaussian smoothing, gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis, to improve the clarity of edges while minimizing unwanted noise.

Features:

- Multi-Image Support: Users can conveniently upload and process multiple image files in one go.

- Gaussian Smoothing: Initial Gaussian smoothing is applied to reduce noise in the images.

- Gradient Computation: The project calculates gradients using Sobel operators for edge detection.

- Non-Maximum Suppression: Non-maximum suppression is employed to highlight the most prominent edges.

- Hysteresis-Based Edge Tracking: Edge tracking by hysteresis is used to connect weak edges.

This project simplifies the task of enhancing images and is a versatile tool for various applications, such as medical imaging, computer vision, and photography.
